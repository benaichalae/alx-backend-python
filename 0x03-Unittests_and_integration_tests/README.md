# Unit Testing and Integration Testing

Unit testing is the process of testing a specific function or component to ensure that it returns the expected results for different sets of inputs. The purpose of unit testing is to test the logic defined inside the function and verify its behavior. It is important to test both standard inputs and corner cases to ensure the function handles all scenarios correctly.

In unit testing, most calls to additional functions should be mocked, especially if they involve network or database operations. Mocking allows you to isolate the function being tested and focus solely on its behavior, without relying on external dependencies.

The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?

Integration testing, on the other hand, aims to test the code path end-to-end. It involves testing the interactions between different parts of your code, including low-level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, or database I/O. Unlike unit testing, integration testing does not involve mocking these external dependencies, as the purpose is to test the actual integration between components.

To execute your tests, you can use the following command:
